There are nine things to look for, and clinical depression is diagnosed when you have at least five of these for more than two weeks:\n\n1. Depressed mood i.e. you feel sad or empty or helpless.\n2. Inability to feel pleasure or excitement i.e. things that previously gave you pleasure, now don't.\n3. Weight loss or weight gain.\n4. Insomnia or an increased desire to sleep.\n5. Slow down i.e. you are not doing things at the same level of speed in which you used to.\n6. Loss of energy or feeling tired easily.\n7. Feeling of inappropriate guilt. Like \u201cI can do much better\u201d or \u201cI'm not living up to what I can do\u201d.\n8. Lack of concentration or unable to make decisions.\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.\nSymptoms are usually severe enough to cause noticeable problems in relationships with others or in day-to-day activities, such as work, school or social activities. In case you observe such symptoms, it's recommended to talk to a psychiatrist."

They said I had no initiative, I was lazy, etc.  But I was suffering.  I felt like damaged goods.  I thought there must be something terribly wrong with me.  \n\nWhen I was a teenager, it was the same thing.  Motivation was a rumor.  I fell asleep in school.  Psychic pain became a normal state that I accepted because I thought I deserved it, after all I was a kid who just didn't have any initiative or desire to make the effort to live like others in the world.  The other kids seemed different, and I did not understand their joy or happiness over what seemed like mundane things.  It's like they could see colors I could not.  The more I suffered the more I was silent about it.    Ashamed of feeling like a loser, I tried very hard each day to go through my life but it took everything I had to get out of bed and go to school.  I played sick alot.  The counselors at school called meetings with my parents because I had very high standardized test scores and a C minus grade point average.  The teachers said I was a rebel which hurt me deeply because that is the last thing I wanted to be.\n\nWhen I was twenty one years old I had an episode of depression, anxiety and panic that was so bad I couldn't get out of bed and go to work for a week.  I told work and my roomate that I was sick with the flu.  I thought I needed to go to the hospital and tried to wait in line in the ER at a large county hospital but I couldn't bear it and went home.  I went to my primary physician and he gave me huge doses of IV vitamins and cortisone.  That pulled me out of it slowly but the depression continued for a few hours every morning for weeks.\n\nIt wasn't until I was an adult and depression became a more acceptable diagnosis and there were better antidepressants that I was treated with an SSRI antidepressant and I have not fallen into a deep depression for 30 years, except for twice when I went off the antidepressants.  One of those times I ended up in a crying spell that lasted for two days.  I couldn't stop sobbing.  It was exhausting.  I thought I was going to die from it.  The psychiatrist who treated me in the ER told me that I was one of those people he would tell to never, ever go off your antidepressants.  That was 20 years ago and I have followed his advice and been relatively depression free."

One of the problems with clinical depression is that it shuts down the ability to discern truth from feeling. What you feel IS the truth. When you are depressed, you can see clearly that life truly is not worth living and that everybody who thinks differently is delusional. You know these truths like they're ingrained in every cell in your body. Anyone who tries to convince you otherwise is a fool or ridiculously naive. Depression rocks! Depression is the searing light of truth exposing all the problems in this world and in your life. You, alone, can see this. You have seen the future and it is shit.\n\nIf you feel like this, and could step outside yourself, you would see instantly that you are seriously depressed but if you are seriously depressed then you can't think of anything but yourself and you can only see yourself from within. You are the centre of your monochromatic universe. So it's an illness that is designed to stop you from being aware of it and it's an illness that prevents you from being motivated to do anything about curing it. Very clever, like one of those mutating viruses that hide inside benign cells.\n\nBut it is 'just' an illness and can be treated. There are lots of very good treatments for it from amazing new psychoactive drugs to highly refined talking therapies and well-known behavioural modifications. They work. Listen to anyone who has suffered and overcome it or at least learned how to cope and they will tell you these treatments work. And it's not hard to find this advice because we are legion."

                    "text": "If you suspect you might be suffering from clinical depression (aka major depression), I would strongly recommend you talk to a psychiatrist as soon as you can. Here's a list of symptoms of a major depressive episode according to the DSM-V. Please note that this is not a guide for self-diagnosis. I'm just posting it to give you a sense of what a depressive episode is. It's still imperative that you talk to a professional!\n\n\n%3E Major Depressive Episode \n\nA. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.\n\n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)\n\n2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).\n\n 3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)\n\n 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n\n 5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\n\n6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. \n\n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick). \n\n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others). \n\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.\n\nB. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. \n\nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.\n\nNote: Criteria A-C constitute a major depressive episode. Major depressive episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. \n\nNote: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual\u2019s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.\n"

Apathy is worse than you\u2019d think; there\u2019s a difference between not giving a damn and not being able to give a damn. You feel empty and exhausted, like life is a painful existence you\u2019re forced to endure.\nIt\u2019ll eventual show physical symptoms. Sleep patterns are messed up, you\u2019re starving/eating all the time, you look like a ghost haunting this world, maybe you started cutting to try and feeling something again\u2026a lot can happen. You\u2019ll suffer just as bad physically as you do mentally. The brain controls everything in the body so if the controls are glitching, the rest of the parts would too.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the end result. Some people can\u2019t withstand the pain anymore and commit suicide. There are those who cut too deep, accidentally killing themselves. People could turn to alcohol or drugs, both possibly ending the same way. Or maybe you do live to be the average age of a person\u2026.but you\u2019d be spending that life tormented by your condition.\n\nDepression poisons the body and spirit.

Many have told me it's gone on long enough and I should be well but they no idea what it is like. I was a very high flyer earning over 6digits p.a when I was 27yo even though I had depression but it was not diagnosed until my first suicide attempt. The world was my oyster but life really sucked even I did everything I could- spending like crazy, holidaying in the most expensive hotels over weekends, fine dining but nothing stopped it. I even gambled on high roller stakes and it didn't matter where I won or lost. I didn't have emotions. Nobody understood me. I had lost over 25kgs and was thinner than I was in Grade6!! Eventually I deliberately ate more so nobody would suspect. Now I just live from day to day."

My latest book \u2018Anxiety is not Depression - Questions and Answers\u2019 includes hundreds of answers I have written to questions here in Quora. This book is sold at below cost.\n\nAs I understand it, clinical depression is diagnosed by a professional, usually a psychiatrist, a medical doctor who specializes in psychiatry. I was diagnosed by a Psychopharmacologist, a psychiatrist specializing in the effect of medications on individuals. There are instances where the diagnosis can be made by other professionals but they vary. According to the Mayo Clinic, \u201cclinical depression is the more-severe form of depression, also known as major depression or major depressive disorder\u201d. I\u2019ll defer to that.\n\nPlease consider following my space here on Quora \u2018Inside Anxiety / Depression\u2019.

Personally, no. I think medication should come into play unless someone\u2019s condition needs to be stabilized prior to therapy (i.e. mood, suicidal ideations, anxiety which is often comorbid with depression, etc.).\n\nThere are many treatment options available depending on the severity of someone\u2019s depression (i.e. inpatient hospitalization, Intensive Outpatient Programs, outpatient therapy, etc.).\n\nHope this helps!\n\np.s. it\u2019s important to note that a support system is extremely crucial to helping manage depression."

A 'friend' once told me I couldn\u2019t use my mental health as an \u2018excuse\u2019 because we all deal with anxiety and depression.\n\nI agree, we do.\n\nHere\u2019s the difference. It\u2019s normal to feel some form of anxiety or depression as a response to external challenges in your life (starting a new job, an abusive relationship, a break-up, a death, etc) and I\u2019m not diminishing the severity of the anxiety and depression these things can cause. Everyone can relate and understand your pain. But when there is no rational cause for the suffering, and it doesn\u2019t improve with time or by changing your circumstances, that\u2019s a mental disorder. And 'neurotypical' people cannot understand this.\n\nI\u2019ve yet to meet someone who has fully overcome mental illnesses (i.e clinical depression, OCD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorders) - as far as I can tell, it doesn\u2019t go away, you just learn to cope with it better. Recovery and relapse go hand in hand, and it takes every ounce of focus and intelligence you have to recover. It\u2019s exhausting fighting your own brain all the time.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is people constantly keep asking \u201cwhat is making you anxious/depressed?\u201d I have no idea! What is making you stable?! Why are you fine???\n\nI experienced life without mental illness briefly last year when I first started taking new meds and I can\u2019t even explain how different I felt. How easy everything was because half my brain wasn\u2019t preoccupied with unconscious bullshit. How much energy and passion I had for things. How connected I felt to everyone because I no longer felt different.\n\nI deluded myself into thinking I\u2019d \u2018recovered\u2019 due to hard work and effort, that it was in my control all along. But the truth is I didn\u2019t do anything different than I normally do, the positive thoughts and behaviour came naturally to me, the way I imagine it does for people who are mentally well.\n\nSome people think we are just doing this to ourselves by being too self-critical and irrational, and not looking after ourselves properly. \u201cYou just need to eat healthy, go to the gym, shower daily, get enough sleep, and think positive.\u201d Right. Those might be simple everyday tasks for someone without depression, but for someone with depression it is a real struggle. When you are in the depths of despair, personal care and positivity is the last thing on your mind. The first thing on your mind is \u201cWhat the fuck is the point?\u201d and trying to overcome that thought is a monumental task in itself.\n\nIt's not easy being close to someone with a mental illness. It\u2019s frustrating as hell, for everyone involved. It might seem like an \u2018excuse\u2019 for just being rude/ignorant, lazy, weak, awkward, negative, or a shit friend, but that\u2019s classic stigma. I explain this shit over and over because it\u2019s a valid reason. The struggle is constant, and when external life challenges coincide with this ongoing internal battle, it can easily get too much. That doesn\u2019t mean we are weak. We are strong as fuck to keep fighting a silent illness every day on top of dealing with difficult life circumstances."

I thought there must be something terribly wrong with me.  \n\nWhen I was a teenager, it was the same thing.  Motivation was a rumor.  I fell asleep in school.  Psychic pain became a normal state that I accepted because I thought I deserved it, after all I was a kid who just didn't have any initiative or desire to make the effort to live like others in the world.  The other kids seemed different, and I did not understand their joy or happiness over what seemed like mundane things.  It's like they could see colors I could not.  The more I suffered the more I was silent about it.    Ashamed of feeling like a loser, I tried very hard each day to go through my life but it took everything I had to get out of bed and go to school.  I played sick alot.  The counselors at school called meetings with my parents because I had very high standardized test scores and a C minus grade point average.  The teachers said I was a rebel which hurt me deeply because that is the last thing I wanted to be.\n\nWhen I was twenty one years old I had an episode of depression, anxiety and panic that was so bad I couldn't get out of bed and go to work for a week.  I told work and my roomate that I was sick with the flu.  I thought I needed to go to the hospital and tried to wait in line in the ER at a large county hospital but I couldn't bear it and went home.  I went to my primary physician and he gave me huge doses of IV vitamins and cortisone.  That pulled me out of it slowly but the depression continued for a few hours every morning for weeks.\n\nIt wasn't until I was an adult and depression became a more acceptable diagnosis and there were better antidepressants that I was treated with an SSRI antidepressant and I have not fallen into a deep depression for 30 years, except for twice when I went off the antidepressants.  One of those times I ended up in a crying spell that lasted for two days.  I couldn't stop sobbing.  It was exhausting.  I thought I was going to die from it.  The psychiatrist who treated me in the ER told me that I was one of those people he would tell to never, ever go off your antidepressants.  That was 20 years ago and I have followed his advice and been relatively depression free."

They crack better jokes and pj(s) and puns. My theory is there are two things that are at work here (a) because they are so depressed they like to make other people laugh, it lets them feel better about themselves even if it's for a moment (b) they use it as an effective mask and camouflage. Like, who will suspect you of being depressed when you are cracking jokes?\n\nAnd that is one major issue of being clinically depressed \u2014 you really obsess about not letting people know. It's really hard to seek help.\n\nTriggered depression, because it's correlated to some event(s), is easier to understand.\n\nClinical depression can also get labeled as \u201cattention seeking behavior\u201d or \u201cbeing lazy and difficult\u201d. Which brings us to the next issue \u2014 depression makes people mean. I can be absolutely savage and need to watch my words constantly. It comes, in part, from having a low patience threshold and continuously being on edge and in part, from the belief that you don't deserve the care, love n' attention you are getting, so you push people away.\n\nWhich leads us to the next point \u2014 how it completely kills your sense of self-worth. You constantly feel guilty for every good thing that comes your way; you can't believe that people really would want to be your friends. Of course, you know you are good or cool or something but it never feels enough or okay. And you question everyone and everything who tries to be near you or care for you. And you feel so bad for taking up people's time, or space, or eating. Some days it becomes absolutely impossible to breath.\n\nThere are good days, sporadically. Not enough. And they leave you feeling even worse later because you allow yourself to feel good for some hours, maybe days and then you feel even more guilty.\n\nIt's like walking around with a 10 pound stone on your chest all the time and trying hard to hide it from other people. Sometimes you do put the stone down, and there are a few precious breaths of freedom but then it's back on the chest and onwards you continue.\n\nAlso, the constant fascination with death. Even if you are not suicidal you think about \u201cceasing\u201d a lot.\n\nAs I said, I wouldn't wish it on my enemies.\n\n\n%3E Originally Answered: What is it like to be clinically depressed?\n"

I had so much energy and I didn't cry myself to sleep or even cry much at all. Everything was enjoyable, the books and video games I used to love didn't leave me feeling empty anymore. All the pain was gone, I didn't suffer from headaches or tension or general body aches. I hardly spent any time in bed and could get everything I wanted done and more. The was no fear to make art that I would just hate anyway. My head felt completely clear, not foggy in the slightest. Learning was a joy instead of a struggle to even pay attention. Interacting with people felt more natural despite that I was still suffering from anxiety. Sleeping was easy, I could fall asleep fairly quickly, woke up refreshed, and slept through the night without night terrors. There was a sense of control, everything I felt, did, or thought felt like my self.\n\nUnfortunately this didn't last and I felt more afraid than ever to take new medications after I plummeted down into depression again."

                    "text": "It's an experience distinct from sadness. Like other have said, clinical depression is a void or an abyss. It's the absence of feeling--like that part of the brain has just been turned off somehow. \n\nYou realize that you are not enjoying things that you should. Receive a compliment from your boss? No feeling. Christmas Eve party with friends and family? No feeling. Snuggle up next to your loved one? No feeling, aside from disappointment at being unable to enjoy a moment that should be beautiful. This is called anhedonia, and it's terrible, especially if you can remember how great those things used to feel.\n\nAt the same time, you can't remember very well. This is related to anhedonia. People remember things that trigger strong emotional responses, and so, if you lack the normal emotional stimulus associated with important events, those events are not committed to memory. There is a two year period of my life during which I was deeply depressed, and I can remember almost nothing from that time.\n\n\nEverything feels like too much work. I mean literally everything. Answering emails, grading papers, focusing on conversation, showering, cooking and eating food--all of it feels overwhelming. You realize how ridiculous it is...how most people do not see preparing lunch as an unbearable chore, for example. And yet  somehow you just can't force yourself forward. This is called avolition, and it's just as bad as anhedonia. If left to my own devices, I would have happily layed in bed all day staring blankly at the ceiling.\n\nThese factors, along with others, combine to send your life into a tailspin. Without treatment, the level of dysfunction some people reach is stunning. I've heard stories of people alienating themselves from friends and family, locking themselves in their apartment for a weeks on end without eating or showering until the pains of starvation force them out into the world to buy groceries. In clinical depression, rock-bottom doesn't necessarily exist. And if it does, many people kill themselves long before they reach it. \n\nI was lucky enough to have a sufficient support network in place to save my life before I was able to do anything drastic. I am eternally thankful for the people who helped me, and saw that I received the treatment I needed. As terrible as depression can be, it IS treatable. Depression is not a terminal disease--which is a truth I try to remember whenever it flares up again."

There are days where everything feels more manageable and it is such a nice feeling and then bam you hit rock bottom again.\n\nI have been struggling for over two years now. I am however learning some new skills. I know how important recognising your triggers are and how important self care is.\n\nI have slowed my life right down and don\u2019t book things in the diary like I used to as I find it too overwhelming.\n\nI take a day at a time now and see how I feel on the day. If I feel better I will plan a visit to friends/ family and if I am not good I spend the day helping myself through it.\n\nExercise is an real help so if I am having a really bad day I try to swim or go for a nice walk"

Except I know I can't help it.\n\nBasic care, like showering, brushing my teeth is incredibly difficult.\n\nI shut myself off from my friends because I felt ashamed about my illness, and because a close friend told me it was my own fault. So I go through life without a support system.\n\nI think I have more empathy than before I got sick, but other than that, there is nothing good about living with major depression."
